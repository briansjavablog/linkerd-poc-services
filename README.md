# Linkerd Service Mesh POC (AKS with Spring Boot microservices)

This demo project uses Linkerd to 'mesh' a number of Spring Boot microservices on Azure AKS.
The project contains the following
 * 4 simple Spring Boot microservices that use that talk to one another via HTTP REST - we'll need this IPC to see Linkerd in action. These services will be containerised and deployed to Kubernetes. 
   * BankingService - public facing aggregator service that calls the 3 services listed below, returning aggregated data.
   * CurrentAccountService - REST API that returns current account data
   * SavingsAccountService - REST API that returns current account data
   * CreditCardService - REST API that returns credit card data
 * scripts for setting up and configuring a Kubernetes cluster on AKS
   * ``createAKSClusterAndACR.sh`` - creates resource group, cluster and container registry
   * ``installLinkerdOnCluster.sh`` - installs Linkerd and Linkerd-viz extension on the cluster
   * ``importNginxIngressControllerChart.sh``- imports nginx charts into the ACR registry created by createAKSClusterAndACR.sh
   * ``createNginxController.sh`` - creates an nginx controller (required by Ingress we'll created later)
   * ``deployAndExposeMicroservices.sh`` - uses Kubectl to install micorservices into the cluster 
 * 4 Kubernetes manifests for creating
   * A namespace for the microservices
   * A Deployment for each microservice
   * A Service for each microservice (the 3 internal microservices are ClusterIP Services and public facing BankingService is a LoadBalancer Service)  
   * An Ingress for exposing the Linkerd and Grafana dashboard 
    
## Pre Requisites
To run this POC you'll need the following in place.
 * An Azure account
 * A Linux environment with Docker, Kubectl and Linkerd installed
 
## Creating the Cluster and related resources

 * Run ``az login`` and authenticate with Azure
 * Run ``createAKSClusterAndACR.sh`` to create a Resource Group, Cluster and Container Registry. The names of these resources are set inside the script.
 * Run ``installLinkerdOnCluster.sh`` to install Linkerd on the cluster. This may take some time (for me it took almost 6 minutes for the Linkerd resources to stand up). This script also installs the Linkerd-viz extension. Linkerd-viz installs an on cluster metrics stack including Prometheus. This provides metrics via Linkerd and Grafana dashboards
 * Run ``importNginxIngressControllerChart`` to install the nginx charts into your container repository. The container repository was created as part of ``createAKSClusterAndACR.sh``
 * Run ``createNginxController.sh`` - creates an nginx controller (required by the Ingress we'll create later). An Ingress namespace is created and the controller is created inside that namespace.

## Verifying the cluster resources
After running the scripts above you can run a few ``Kubectl`` commands to verify that the expected resources are there.

Run ``kubectl get ns`` to see all namespaces. You should see banking-service, ingress, linkerd and linkerd-viz listed.

Run ``kubectl get all -n linkerd`` to see the linkerd resources. You can do the same for the linkerd-viz and ingress namespaces.

## Deploying the microservices 
The microservices images have already been built and pushed to my Dockerhub repo so you donâ€™t need to worry about building the microservices images unless you want to change the code. 

 * Run ``deployAndExposeMicroservices.sh`` to install the microservices. This script will use Kubectl to install 
   * namespace.yaml - creates a banking-services namespace for the microservice resources we're going to create
   * deployments.yaml - contains Deployment definitions for each of the 4 microservices. These deployments include a Linkerd annotation that tells Linkerd to 'mesh' these resources
   * services.yaml - creates 4 Services, one for each microservice. The backend services (CurrentAccountService, SavingsAccountService & CreditCardService) each have a ClusterIP Service. The bankingService aggregator is a LoadBalancer Service with a public IP so that we can expose it outside the cluster. We'll use this later to test the microservices and see Linkerd in action.
   * ingress.yaml - creates an Ingress object (secured by Basic HTTP Auth) that exposes the Linkerd and Grafana dashboards

## Testing the microservices 
Next run ``kubectl get svc -n bank-service`` to see the Services created for the microservices. You should see the public IP of the exposed banking-service. We'll use that to test the service next.

Run ``curl 52.142.187.54/api/account-details/12345`` (replace 52.142.187.54 with the public IP from your banking-service Service). You should see a JSON payload returned.

## Testing the Linkerd and Grafana dashboards 
Run ``kubectl get all -n ingress`` to see Ingress controllers public facing IP.

You can use this IP to access the Linkerd and Grafana dashboards. Note that this Ingress Controller is used by the Ingress we created earlier, to expose the Linkerd and Grafana dashboards. The Ingress is secured with HTTP Basic auth so you'll be prompted for a username and password - use admin/admin. These creds are set in a Secret object that is created along with the Ingress. This approach is for demo purposes only.

After logging in , select the bank-services namespace to view the microservices metrics

Clicking on the Grafana icons will load a pre built Grafana dashboard
